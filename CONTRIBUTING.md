# Contributing to syntheticdata

Thank you for your interest in contributing to syntheticdata! This
document outlines how to propose changes and submit contributions.

## Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please [open an
issue](https://github.com/CuiweiG/syntheticdata/issues/new) with a
minimal reproducible example. The
[reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package is the preferred way to
create one. Include:

- A brief description of the expected vs. actual behaviour
- A reprex that demonstrates the problem
- Output of [`sessionInfo()`](https://rdrr.io/r/utils/sessionInfo.html)
  or `devtools::session_info()`

## Suggesting Features

Feature requests are welcome. Please open an issue describing the use
case and any alternatives you have considered.
